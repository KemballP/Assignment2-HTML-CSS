Webpage.html is the Main file (forgot to change it to Index.html)
Opening the Webpage.html file with a live server extension in vsCode displays the webpage correctly, local browsers create a CORS error for me, may just be on my end but I spent far too long trying to fix it.
The Contact.html file, when opened separately, correctly validates my form, the Webpage.html file doesn't seem to do so when navigating to the Contact section. 

Above all, I have learned the impact that applications like Angular have had on the developper community, this same webpage would have taken me minutes, not hours, and with far less headache and errors. 
That being said, I would love some feedback on exactly why I struggled as much with this as I did. I could have just followed the rubric but I (perhaps erroneously) wanted to challenge myself.
